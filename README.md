# AIQueue (AIQ): Autonomous Brand Amplification Agent Orchestration

![AIQueue Logo/Banner - *Placeholder for a compelling visual*]

## üöÄ Welcome to AIQueue!

**AIQueue** is an innovative, JVM-based (Kotlin/Java) framework designed to empower brands to amplify their unique voice and visual identity across all digital platforms autonomously. Moving beyond simple bots, AIQueue builds "agentic flows" that can plan, adapt, and accomplish goals in flexible ways, acting as your self-optimizing content agency.

**Inspired by and built upon cutting-edge agent frameworks like Embabel**, AIQueue leverages dynamic planning, a multi-LLM strategy, and a robust Model Context Protocol (MCP) tooling layer to deliver unparalleled content consistency and performance.

## ‚ú® What AIQueue Does

* **Brand Voice & Visual Consistency:** Strictly adheres to your defined brand personality and visual guidelines (Color, Typography, Photography, etc.) through its unique **Brand Essence Core-Frame**.
* **Dynamic Content Repurposing:** Transforms long-form content into platform-specific shorts, posts, tweets, and more, all while maintaining brand integrity.
* **Real-time Optimization:** Continuously learns from content performance analytics and user preferences to refine output and optimize for engagement and growth.
* **Intelligent Agent Orchestration:** Utilizes a hierarchy of specialized AI agents (e.g., Content Creation Machine, Prompt Optimizer, Workflow Manager) that communicate seamlessly to execute complex tasks.
* **Revenue-Driven:** Focuses on monetization through affiliate partnerships, course creation, and community building, moving beyond traditional ad models.
* **MCP-Driven Tooling:** Integrates with external tools and automations (like Windmill, Docker MCP tools, web search) via the Model Context Protocol for modularity and scalability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

AIQueue is built on the **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)** using Kotlin and Java, leveraging the power of the **Embabel Agent Framework** for its core agentic capabilities.

* **Core Framework:** Embabel (JVM-based, Kotlin-first)
* **LLMs:** Multi-LLM strategy (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, Mistral, Llama, Ollama etc.)
* **Tooling & Automation:** Windmill (as primary MCP Server), Docker MCP
* **Memory:** Vector Databases (Pinecone, Chroma, Weaviate), Relational Databases (PostgreSQL), File Storage (S3)

## üöÄ Quick Start (Coming Soon!)

Want to get an AIQueue agent running in minutes? We're setting up simplified setup instructions. In the meantime, you can explore the foundational Embabel framework:

1.  **Clone the Embabel Template:** 
2.  **Set up API Keys:** Ensure you have  and optionally  environment variables.
3.  **Run with Docker MCP Tools:** Have Docker Desktop with the MCP extension installed and activate Brave Search, Fetch, Puppeteer, and Wikipedia tools.

*For detailed examples and tutorials, see the [Embabel Agent Examples Repository](https://github.com/embabel/embabel-agent-examples).*

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap & Contributing

AIQueue is in active development, following a phased roadmap outlined in our detailed blueprint. We welcome contributions from the community!

* **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4):** Foundation & First Content (Core infrastructure, basic content generation, analytics setup, dog-fooding).
* **Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8):** MVP Content Engine & Early Sales (Refined cross-platform posting, core repurposing, initial monetization tests).
* **Phase 3 (Weeks 9-12):** Scale & Sustainability (Advanced features, deeper AI integrations, revenue acceleration).

We believe in **dog-fooding** ‚Äì using AI agents to accelerate every aspect of this project's development. If you're excited about building the future of autonomous brand amplification, dive in!
